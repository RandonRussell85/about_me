            <p>
                My name is Randon Russell, I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. I was in the 
                insurance field selling health insurnace, but decided to change career paths and go into tech.
                While I am a nervous for the change, I took a chance and took the next step.I am currently 
                enrolled in a coding bootcamp at UCLA extension program. I hope to one day take what I learn 
                from the program and apply it torwards making my own app one day, that will known around the world.
